Ideas:

* [ ] Template fingerprinting and deduplication
* [ ] NSFW template detection
* [ ] Encode image source data into the image itself (ideally one that survives compression)
* [ ] Add `?debug` to URL to show data rendered as image instead of real image
* [ ] Detect URLs in text and block
* [x] Max text box width
* [x] Text anchor positions
* [x] Stroked/Filled/Stroked+Filled text variants
* [ ] Limit text count
