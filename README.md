Ideas:

* Template fingerprinting and deduplication
* NSFW template detection
* Encode image source data into the image itself (ideally one that survives compression)
* Add `?debug` to URL to show data rendered as image instead of real image
* Detect URLs in text and block
* Max text box width
* Text anchor positions
* Stroked/Filled/Stroked+Filled text variants
* Limit text count
